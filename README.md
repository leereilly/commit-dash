[Commit Dash](https://leereilly.itch.io/commit-dash) is an infinite runner inspired by GitHub’s contribution graph! Jump and dodge your way across rolling columns of green squares. How high can you score before the commit streak ends?

A 100% vibe-coded [entry for the 2025 Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025/rate/4084893) with GitHub Copilot. Thanksgiving and kids' college applications got in the way of me finishing it, but oh well!

**Controls:** <kbd>Space</kbd> to jump. Press <kbd>Space</kbd> twice to double-jump. Hold <kbd>Space</kbd> to long jump.
